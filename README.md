# Bankruptcy-Predicition-Using-Ensemble-Model
Ensemble models are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking). The proposed model will provide key factors and key ratios regarding bankruptcy, it was done using the predefined Qualitative bankruptcy data set and Quantitative bankruptcy data set in Ensemble model with different models. Then, the observations will be compared with some of the widely used classification models: Random Forests, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression. Finally, we analyze and evaluate the performance of the models on the validation datasets using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc., and rank the models accordingly. This will provide
highly correlated factors and increase the consciousness of the banks.
